DeepInstinct - Code Challenge

An automation program that gets a path to a report file in the following format:

[Date Time] [Guard #X] [Action(begin shift\falls asleep\wakes up)]

The program finds which guard is most likely to fall asleep (the guard that has slept most minutes in total) and the time he most likely to be asleep.

In order to execute the whole test set, run this command:

python -m unittest main.py
